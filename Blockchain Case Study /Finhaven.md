The company has developed Finhaven Investment platform that leverages blockchain technology and digital securities. The platform covers major activities in capital markets - KYC/AML, suitability, raising capital, primary distribution, trading of securities, clearing & settlement and corporate actions. 

The system allows for real time settlement and eliminates the need for external clearing agencies, central depositories and custodians.

## **Why This Matters**
In the traditional capital markets, if a company wants to go public (IPO), it must bear underwriting fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities exchange registration fees and other costs. Apart from these fees, the company has bear the compliance cost in terms of requirements to be met. Considering these fees, going public doesnot make sense for many private companies. 

The biggest challenge facing accredited investor, who has invested in a private company is to find buyers, as there are no reasonable avenues for private share sale.

The company aims to address the inefficiencies in the private markets through leveraging blockchain i.e. tokenization of securities.  In theory, it allows for the buying and selling of tokens (that represent securities) on a blockchain, which could eliminate the need for transfer agents, custodians and clearing agencies through secure digital settlements.

In practice, the company provides a market place, where accreditor investor can buy/sell private securities and companies can raise capital.  Both the transactions take place without need of middlemen through safe, secure, regulated digital transactions — reducing inefficiency for issuers and investors alike.
